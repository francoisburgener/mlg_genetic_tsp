  <h2>Objective</h2>

  Use a genetic algorithm in Python to solve diverse optimization problems.  
  
  <hr>
  <p>
  To start, we must setup a Python 2.7 environment, because
  <b>pyevolve</b> has not been ported to Python 3 yet :(
  </p>
  <p>
  You will find a requirement file for that: <a
  href="GA_py27_requirements.txt">GA_py27_requirements.txt</a>. Therefore,
  try the following steps:
  </p>
  <pre>
  conda create -n python27 python=2.7
  conda activate python27
  pip install -r GA_py27_requirements.txt
  python -m ipykernel install --user --name python27 --display-name python27
  jupyter notebook -> and select the python27 kernel
  </pre>
  
  <p>
  Download the following <a href="MLG_pyevolve_examples.zip">collection of notebooks</a>
  containing several examples of GA applications.
  </p>
  
  <h2>1. Minimal pyevolve Genetic Algorithm</h2>
  <p>
  The notebook <b>GA_evo-bitstring-minimal.ipynb</b> example uses pyevolve to evolve a bitstring of only ones.
  </p>
  <h2>2. Configuring the GA algorithm and plotting the evolution</h2>

  <p>
  The notebook <b>GA_evo-bitstring.ipynb</b> example uses pyevolve to
  evolve a bitstring of only ones. It allows the user to configure the
  GA by indicating the size of the population, the mutation and
  crossover parameters, etc. It moreover, records statistics about the
  evolved population to allow the user to plot the evolution of the
  fitness over generations.
  </p>
  
  <h2>3. Evolution of a list of values</h2>

  <p>
  The notebook <b>GA_evo-list.ipynb</b> example uses pyevolve to
  evolve a chromosome composed of a list of elements instead of a
  bitstring. A minimal application consists on evolving a list of
  only zeroes, starting from random integer values in a given range.
  This example introduces the use of the method <b>stepCallback</b>
  that allows the user to monitor the evolution process. Here, we
  print the current best solution found by the genetic algorithm.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Evolution of a string: Dawkin's Weasel experiment</h2>
  
  <p>
  The notebook <b>GA_evo-string.ipynb</b> example uses pyevolve to
  evolve a chromosome composed of a list of integers in the range 65
  to 95, which includes the ASCII letters 'A' to 'Z' and '_', herein
  used as a space between words. We attempt to evolve the sequence of
  letters that compose the phrase: "METHINKS_IT_IS_LIKE_A_WEASEL". 
  </p>

  <h2>5. Function maximization</h2>

  <p>
  The notebook <b>GA_evo-binaryMaxFunc.ipynb</b> example uses pyevolve
  to evolve the parameters of an equation (shown below) that we want to maximize:
  </p>

  <p>
  f = (x0 * x1 * x2 * x3) / (x4 * x5 * x6 * x7), where x0, x1,
  ... x7 are integers in the range 1 &lt; xi &lt; 16.
  </p>

  <p>
  The solution to this problem is very easy... f is maximized when x0 =
  x1 = x2 = x3 = 16 and  x4 = x5 = x6 = x7 = 1.
  </p>
  <p>
  The interest of this example is that it will show you how important is
  the coding of the solution into the efficacy of a genetic
  algorithm. To understand this, run the notebook and see if it can
  solve the proposed problem. Observe how we coded the values: every xi
  codes in binary an integer value, thus xi = bit3 * 2^3 + bit2 * 2^2
  + bit1 * 2^1 + bit0 * 2^0, and '0000' codes for 16.
  </p>
  <p>
  What is the maximum fitness ?<br>
  What is the bitstring that codes the optimal solution ?<br>
  What is the problem ? can you code the solution in a different way to
  facilitate the evolutionary process ?<p>
  </p>

  <h2>6. The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)</h2>

  <p>
  The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question:
  Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities,
  what is the <b>shortest</b> possible route that visits each city <b>exactly once</b>
  and returns to the origin city? It is an NP-hard problem in
  combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and
  theoretical computer science [Wikipedia].
  </p>
  <p>
  The objective of this exercise is to solve the TSP problem for a set
  of 14 cities in Burma, officially the Republic of the Union of
  Myanmar. The following vectors give the GPS position of each city.
  </p>
  <pre>
   LAT = [16.47, 16.47, 20.09, 22.39, 25.23, 22.00, 20.47, 
          17.20, 16.30, 14.05, 16.53, 21.52, 19.41, 20.09]

   LON = [96.10, 94.44, 92.54, 93.37, 97.24, 96.05, 97.02, 
          96.29, 97.38, 98.12, 97.38, 95.59, 97.13, 94.55]
  </pre>

  <p>
  Consider that the distance between two cities is not the
  Euclidean distance. You have to consider that they are points on the
  surface of the Earth, which can be considered to be an <b>oblate
  spheroid</b>.
